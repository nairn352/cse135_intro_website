        Hello! My name is Neha Nair. I am currently a third-year Computer Science major
        and Business minor at the University of California, San Diego. Through my coursework, I have become comfortable
        with programming in Python, Java, and C++, as well as using machine learning tools to aid data analysis in various contexts.
        My favorite data analysis project was one in which I analyzed how different publication and marketing factors
        (e.g., including a novel on a celebrity book club list) impact the success of a novel on the <i>New York Times Bestseller List</i>!
        </p>
        <p class = "main-text">
        Fear not... I have a few other (more exciting) interests as well. I am currently the President of the International Women's Health Organization 
        at UC San Diego. Our club's mission is to help end period poverty in San Diego and to raise awareness about inequities that exist in the healthcare
        sphere, particularly in regards to women's health. I am also a copy editor for <i>The Triton</i>, UC San Diego's independent, student-run online
        newspaper, and a member of Women in Computing (WIC)!
        </p>
        <p class = "main-text">
        If I am not doing any of the aforementioned activities, I'm probably reading or crocheting. :)
        </p>

        Thanks for sticking around to learn a bit more about me!
